The idea of this package is to provide defuss components
that would implement a window system allowing to build
desktop UIs, including resizable, movable windows,
task menu, start menu and desktop icons. 

Such a UI allows for complex applications to be implemented
in a meaningful way -- such as image editing, audio editing, text editing and alike. 

All components in this module must follow the defuss-ui-theme-spec.
