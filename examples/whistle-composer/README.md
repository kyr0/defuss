## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your `Astro` + `defuss` project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├-- public/
│   └-- favicon.svg
│   └-- ...
├-- src/
│   ├-- components/
│   │   └-- App.tsx
│   │   └-- Counter.tsx
│   ├-- layouts/
│   │   └-- Layout.astro
│   │   └-- Layout.css
│   ├-- pages/
│   │   └-- index.astro
│   └-- env.d.ts
├-- package.json
└-- astro.config.ts
└-- tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any `Astro` / `defuss` components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Get a decent package manager

We recommend using `bun` as a package manager. It's fast, mature and handles monorepos well. If you haven't installed `bun` yet:

```bash
npm i -g bun@^1.3.9
```

### 2. Install the projects dependencies

```bash
bun i --frozen
```

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
